            <h2>Explore the foodie in you!</h2>
            <p>I have a lot of gratitude towards my mum. For me, mum's food was the best, I still associate my childhood memories with the food I ate during festivals, at boarding school and home. With plenty of food around, its weird that not even once I felt that I want to grow up and be able to cook good food. I guess, that's not what you are encouraged to do if you are growing up in an Asian country like India. You are sorta expected to be in the race, get a fancy college degree and earn top money. And what's cooking got to do with it? I am proud of my roots!</p>
